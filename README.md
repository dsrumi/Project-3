# NREVSS Public Health Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes public health data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS), focusing on influenza surveillance and mortality data across different states in the United States.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes several datasets located in the `Data` directory:
- `AgeViewBySeason.csv`: Flu data analyzed by age groups and seasons
- `MortalityDataUpdated(State).csv`: Updated mortality statistics by state
- `Mortality_New.csv`: Recent mortality data
- `State_Activity_Level.csv`: Flu activity levels by state
- `Virus_Types_by_State.csv`: Distribution of different virus types across states
- `flu_data_by_state.csv`: Comprehensive flu statistics by state

## Analysis
The main analysis is conducted in the Jupyter notebook `NREVSS_Public_Health.ipynb`, which includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Statistical analysis of flu trends
- Visualization of health data
- State-by-state comparisons
- Mortality rate analysis

## Requirements
